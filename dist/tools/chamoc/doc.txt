## CHAMOC (Communication Handler for Addressing Management | Origin client)

The module CHAMOC It's used for client-side communication for nib routing table.
In this tools will be there an compiled program called CHAMOC.out that has a client
interface with an m4a-24g board. The client node will be sending `chamoc_message_t` data.
that contains an `[Type message]` tell to the system how process the message. (Nib_add or Nib_del),
others field are the `[sequence number], [host ip address] to add as neighborh route,
and the `[network lenght prefix] generally is /64.

### Steps to initialize the client socket

- You should has the chamos_server in your m4a-24g board (Also, could run the chamoc_server inside to the test directory)
- Run the ./start_network.sh script and assign the board global address as argument (e.g: 2001:db8::1 64)
- Run the ./autoconfig.sh script
- Wait that nib_request is accepted.

### start_network.sh

When you are running start_network.sh and add an ipv6 address like this:
```sh
    ./start_network.sh 2001:db8::1/64
```
you are assigning to the m4a-24g board (`usb-cdc element`) the global address to stablish the communication
in the wired interface.

### Testing communication

before to run the autoconfig.sh script you can do some pings to the m4a-24g board interface.
first follow these steps to locate, and do ping between both devices.

- Locate your interface

using net-tools
```sh
    ifconfig
    # Output
    enx5a008df2d56b: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.1.199  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.1.255
        inet6 fe80::98eb:d858:51a0:dcc0  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        inet6 2001:db8::1  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0<global>
        ether 5a:00:8d:f2:d5:6b  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
...

```

```sh
    ifconfig
```

with ip address command.
```sh
    ip address show
    # Output
    22: enx5a008df2d56b: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel s
    ...
        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 2001:db8::1/64 scope global
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::98eb:d858:51a0:dcc0/64 scope link noprefixroute
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

```
@note : Observe that the interface has the wish global address (e.g: 2001:db8::1/64).

- Do ping6 to the M4a-24g address `2001:db8::2/64`
```sh
    ping 2001:db8::2 -c3
    # expected output
    PING 2001:db8::2(2001:db8::2) 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from 2001:db8::2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.911 ms
    64 bytes from 2001:db8::2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1.02 ms
    64 bytes from 2001:db8::2: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=1.01 ms
```

### autoconfigure:

Running the script you will has as result the compilation and execution to the client program CHAMOC.out
This test automatically will be start sending the nib_add and nib_del request taking as parameters.
`[Name of interface]``[ip address]``[prefix_len].

``sh
    ./autoconfigure.sh
    Waiting for network interface.
    Start sending a nib add request
    Bad Request, Trying Again           # Timeout time to wait a response
    Request Confirmed                   # Case when the request was correctly sent
    Start sending a nib delete request
    Request Confirmed
```

@note: the chamoc intercomunnication has five attempts to wait a response from the server

### Running with chamoc_server
    in the folder /test, there are an example of chamoc_server running. this will be
    waiting and MSG_NIB_ADD or MSG_NIB_DEL, if these are received correctly response with a
    MSG_ACK, in case that the message was wrong received, the server will send an MSG_NACK.
    To start this server only has to run the script in the test_folder.
