@brief   Client tool to connect via Linux host

#### The autoconfigure script has 3 phases:

- Check if exist an USB-CDC-ECM interface.
- Add address and routing configuration from the host to given interface.
- Remove address and routing configurations

The ipv6 address to assign to the host should be in the same range of the network
that the ipv6 address of the usb-cdc-ecm interface.

@note: take careful with the subnets prefix, to understand which number of
addresses are available in the network range.
