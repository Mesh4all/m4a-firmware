## Requirements {#rpl_dag_requirements}

TO run RPL protocol you need a board with radio module incorporated. because
rpl runs to all Zigbee and IEEE802.15.4 devices.
- Use 2 radio devices to stablish connections.
- the second board must has the `mesh4all_rpl_dodag` example flashed

## Build and flashing {#rpl_dag_flashing}
Starts flashing the board and see the building process to be completed.
```
make -C examples/mesh4all_rpl_dag flash term
```

## Getting Started {#rpl_dag_basic}

First start building and flashing this example in a m4a-24g Board. (if you have connected the secondary board
running in `DODAG` mode, disconnect it, until to last step).
The DAG mode in rpl is a passive node that should receive an ipv6 address when it's connected
in the radio network. So when your run `ifconfig` command of the shell. you could see that
you donÂ´t has an ipv6 global address until the secondary board it's active in rpl `DODAG` mode.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Now, connect your DODAG board and see how the device will be inside the radio network
