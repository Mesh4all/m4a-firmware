### Unique Id

In this module you get a specific Id for each device and you have three options to get an unique IPV6 address,
which can be edited in the config menu:

1) Static: It is made with the cpu id and it is the same between reboots and unique for each device.
2) Random: A random address that is generated with the same fixed header. This option has a seed
cryptographically secure using NETOPT_RANDOM.
3) Custom: This option allows you to edit both the header and the address. The default address is "1111:2222".

Note: The default header is "2001:db8".
