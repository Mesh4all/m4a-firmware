### What goes here?
You have 3 options to get the unique ipv6 address, which can be edited in the config menu:

1) Static: It is make with the cpu id and it is the same between reboots,
unique for each device.
2) Random: A random address that is generated with the same fixed header
as the first option.
3) Custom: This option allows you to edit both the header and the default
address is "1111:2222".

Note: The default header is "2001:db8".


### TO DO:
Use of ``` _xtimer_now ``` as seed is not cryptographically secure.

Use of ``` seed = 0``` as seed is not cryptographically secure.
