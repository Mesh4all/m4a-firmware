# Storage

This module saves data in the flash memory in pages that we can write and read.

Notes:

- The max size to save in the page is 16
- The data could not be greater than 64 bytes
- Data formats allowed are string and uint8
- the functions mtd_write_string and mtd_write_uint8 is not recommended to use it directly, use the functions in library
