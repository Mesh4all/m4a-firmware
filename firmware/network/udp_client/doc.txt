### Udp Client

UDP is the abbreviation of User Datagram Protocol. UDP makes use of Internet Protocol of the TCP/IP suit.
In communications using UDP, a client program sends a message packet to a destination server where in the
destination server also runs on UDP.
UDP is commonly used in time-sensitive communications where occasionally dropping packets is better than waiting.
Voice and video traffic are sent using this protocol because they are both time-sensitive and designed to handle
some level of loss. For example VOIP (voice over IP), which is used by many internet-based telephone services,
operates over UDP. This is because a staticy phone conversation is preferable to one that is crystal clear but
heavily delayed.

An Udp client makes request to a server that works under UDP protocol, once the request is processed the server response to the client.

This module is used to set an udp client. The function ``` udp_send ``` is used to send the sensors values specifying port,
address to which the message will be sent, the message (parameter) and the size of the message. also could be used to send a string or byte array
to process a group of data.

An Udp client doesn't needs listen a response, an udp client could be a data collector. sending constantly times a group of data to the server Udp.
