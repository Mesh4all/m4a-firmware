@defgroup m4a-firmware  Reference firmware

### Firmware

This is the core of Mesh4All, you can find specific documentation for the sys, peripherals, and network folders.

### Network

This section has modules like:

    - UDP client: Make use of Internet Protocol of the TCP/IP suit.

    - UDP server: Process all request sent by an udp client device.

    - RPL protocol: The functions to start RPL and add a node dodag (Root)
or dag (Slave).

    - Radio: Module that handles all low power and low consumption wireless devices.

    - Net tools: Contains all about networks tools.

    - Chamos (Communication Handler for Addressing Management | Origin Server): It's used for
server-side communication.

    - Border Router: The module sets an IPV6 address in a wireless or wired interface.

### Peripherals

    - Moisture sensor: Gets humidity and temperature data of a certain environment.

    - Temperature sensor (DS18): Get the data of the temperature sensor.

### Sys

    - AT commands: Establish a connection with a wifi-subsystem, which handles AT commands
sent through the shell.

    - Serialization:  Get and decode a data of the sensors arrived from udp server and decodes
the message before sending it to udp client. This implementation uses a library tinycbor.

    - Storage: Saves data in the flash memory in pages that we can write and read, the max size
to save is 16 page.

    - Unique_id: Get a specific id for each device and you have three options to get an unique
IPV6 address (static, random, custom).
