### Analog Capacitive Moisture sensor V1.2

This module contains all about the manage the read data from the Moisture sensor. It's an Analog
sensor that operates betwwen 3.3V and 5.0V, has three pins VCC (Red wire), GND (Black wire), DATA (Yellow Wire),
There is a fixed frequency oscillator that is built with a 555 Timer IC. The square wave generated is then fed
to the sensor like a capacitor. To a square wave signal that capacitor, however, has a certain reactance, or
for argumentâ€™s sake a resistance that forms a voltage divider with a pure ohm type resistor (the 10k one on pin 3).
The greater is the soil moisture, the higher the capacitance of the sensor. Consequently, there is a smaller reactance
to the square wave, thus lowering the voltage on the signal line. The voltage on the Analog signalpin can be measured by
an analog pin of a MCU.

@note The resolution supported is 10 bit.

@warning There a line drawn on the analog sensor, this represent the operating zone to get the humidity from the soil and
the circuit zone of the device (This limits could affect the sensor and its functionality).
