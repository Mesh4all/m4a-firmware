### Peripherals
Specific documentation for our reference peripherals;
In the next module you can find:

### Kconfig Setup

The peripherals has an effect in each board. a property of the board is periph_conf where is all
specifications of each communication protocol used, converters analog to digital, and PWM parameters.
So, peripherals actually provides support to manage de VREF of ADC channels, This will give more precision
with the measurements.

 | Macro of the periph_conf        | Voltage Referenced                   | type            |
 |:-------------------------------:|:------------------------------------:|:---------------:|
 |   CONFIG_ADC_VREF_DEFAULT       |      1.0V                            |     Internal    |
 |   CONFIG_ADC_VREF_INTVCC0       |      1/1.48 VDDANA                   |     Internal    |
 |   CONFIG_ADC_VREF_INTVCC1       |  1/2 VDDANA (only for VDDANA > 2.0V) |     Internal    |
 |   CONFIG_ADC_VREF_EXT1          |      External reference  #1          |     External    |
 |   CONFIG_ADC_VREF_EXT2          |      External reference  #2          |     External    |

### Ds18_sensor

This is a soil temperature sensor that could provide the current measurement
in degrees centigrades "Â°C". this works with any digital pin, but needs to use the
one wire protocol to obtain the data from itself.

### Moisture_sensor

A peripheral that could read through adc pins, getting an analog measurement, this works with a
10-bit resolution, and it's adjustable to work with 3.3V (in low consumption) and 5V for more
information about the peripheral see @ref moisture_sensor module
