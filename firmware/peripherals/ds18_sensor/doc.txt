### Ds18 soil sensor

The ds18b20 is a temperature sensor with a range between -55 °C and 125 °C, its operative
voltage is 3V or 5V respectively, only needs a data pin to transfer data an a MCU using one-wire communication.
Has an acurracy of 0.5 °C. The output resolution is programmable between 9 - 12 bits, conversion time of 750 ms
at 12-bit resolution.

### Pinout scheme

This module works with the ds18b20 peripheral, this implement two steps,
`init_temperature_sensor()` and `get_temperature_value()`. the first function checks
if the peripheral is connected to a designed pin. when the initialization it's successfully returns `DS18_OK`
in case that the peripheral was not found returns a `DS18_ERROR`.

To the function `get_temperature_value()` needs receive a int16_t variable as parameter (Signed Integer variable), because the
peripheral could operates with positive and negative values. when you are reading the received data it could be observed
in this way:

 | Value read  |Integer part       | Decimal part      | Temp read in °C |
 |:-----------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:---------------:|
 |    1517     |      15           |         17        |  15.17 °C       |
 |    -1517    |      -15          |         17        | -15.17 °C       |
