## Test DS18 sensor

Here unit tests are performed on the ds18_sensor module.
To perform a successful test you must connect the ds18 temperature sensor to your board.

you must also add the gpio where your board will be connected in the test init. Run first menuconfig and add the pin number
where is connected the sensor.

```
make menuconfig all
```
You take a look in the main.c
```c
int err = init_temperature_sensor(CONFIG_PIN_TEMP_SENSOR);
```
You could see that the CONFIG_PIN_TEMP_SENSOR is a reference to the configurate pin set in the menuconfig.
To test the code in automatic mode:

```c
make flash test
```
