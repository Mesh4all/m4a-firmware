## Test documentation

Here are the unit tests of the udp client module,
in which a udp server is started and through emUnit messages are sent from the client module.
For now you can only send messages to ipv6 address.

To test the code in automatic mode:

```c
make flash test

```

To test the code in interactive mode:

```c
make flash term

```
