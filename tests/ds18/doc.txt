## Test DS18 sensor

Here unit tests are performed on the ds18_sensor module.
To perform a successful test you must connect the ds18 temperature sensor to your board.

you must also add the gpio where your board will be connected in the test init function in the main.c file

```c
void test_init_ds18(void) {
     int err = init_temperature_sensor(your_gpio);

     TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_INT(0, error);
}
```

To test the code in automatic mode:

```c
make flash test
```
