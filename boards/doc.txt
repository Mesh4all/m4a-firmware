@defgroup boards Supported Boards

# What goes here?

All those boards supported by Mesh4all and not defined in RIOT-OS

## Board requirements

The goal of this repo is not to list general purpose dev boards or a dev-kit, however the goal is
 to accommodate those boards with a specific purpose, such as:

- Environmental monitoring and metering systems
- Data communication
- Data storage and distribution
- Action/Reaction systems

### Environmental monitoring

Systems collecting eviromental data such as gases, temperature, pressure, moisture, etc or metering systems designed to measure any kind of data such as distance, weight, volume, positioning, etc.

### Data communications

Systems capable of transmitting and receiving data in any way, radio, wire, optical, etc. not defined in RIOT-OS

### Data storage and distribution

Data storage systems and those intended for their distribution in any way, synchronously or asynchronously.

### Action/Reaction systems

Systems with a certain degree of autonomy, capable of collecting data and reacting based on that data, in loop or loop with bypass option.
